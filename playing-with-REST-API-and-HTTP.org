#+TITLE: Playing With Rest Api And HTTP

* First PoC
To get it work the followings are needed (in Doom Emacs):
+ Add these into pakcages.el:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! restclient)
(package! ob-restclient)
  #+end_src
  + Add these lines into config.el:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    '((dot . t)
      (restclient . t)))
    #+end_src
    This is the first try:
#+begin_src restclient
GET http://example.com
#+end_src
